#### Community building

I am very active in community events in the Philippines. 

Some of my community involvement are the ff:

- Python PH Volunteer 
- Women Who Code Volunteer
- Hacktober Fest

I also volunteer at a local high school to mentor the research students. Since 2015, I am constantly helping local high schools to facilitate the student's research projects. I help and coach students so that they can integrate machine learning and other technologies to their research projects.
