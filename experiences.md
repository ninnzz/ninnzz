## Machine Learning Engineer
Company: Hacarus

Duration: 2016/11 - 2022/09   

Started out as one of the two application developer with the main responsibility of ML integration.
I handled all the backend and architecture responsibilities.
The first model we integrated was a recommendation model that suggest meals based on food nutrition restrictions.

Just several months after, we moved into more complex dataset such as images.
The company transition to other industries like industrial and medical applications.
As such, I also became responsible for other customer facing projects. I handled most of the backend, ML integrations, and architecture setup.

We built an inspection application that can be used in factory line setup. We added models for medical data as well.
This proved to be more challenging due to the private nature of the datasets.

As the company grows, I also became responsible for code reviews and standards for other junior members.
Through my initiative, we put up MLOps on several projects. We also improved model performance by integrating parameter tuning to our pipelines.

Overall, here's the rundown of what my day to day looks like:

- Build and maintain backend interface for existing and new projects
- Design the overall project structure and setup. Most of our bigger projects would typically consist of several micro-services.
- Manage data ingestion, data cleaning, and data storage.
- Implement better development process through code standardization and implementation of best practices.
- Make sure all models are deployed correctly using MLOps.

Some of the tech stack I used:

- Flask and FastAPI for backend
- MySQL, Redis (caching), Elasticsearch
- Deep Learning (Keras, Torch, TF) and in house ML models
- DVC for data versioning and gitlab for MLOps pipelines
- AWS, all our cloud setup is hosted in aws

## Backend and DevOps Engineer
Company: MCN Freedom (Any.tv)

Duration: 2014/02 - 2016/11

I joined the company after months of persuation from the CEO. I met him on a dev meetup when they were pitching their products and the tech stack they used.
We started out as a team of 6 developers. My main focus is building the financial data processing side of the product.
The company is a youtube muti-channel network, so we had to process a lot of channel data monthly.

The initial product was hosted in a non-managed cloud provider so I proposed to the management to move our setup to AWS.
AWS was still new that time but given my knowledge on it, I created a proposal which led us to migrate our system to AWS.
I led the initiative and created migration plans and architecture design for our projects.

As our team grow, I became part of the core team that handles the data processing and other company sensitive projects.
I also led several projects including the music streaming and copyright detection projects.
I was mentored by two of our top manages both in technical and non-technical aspects of project management.

My daily routine would revolve on:

- Checking on the progress of other members.
- Research and development for new products.
- Building data pipelines to improve ingestion and integration of youtube data (200+ gb each batch)
- Interfacing with partners and stakeholders on some of our projects.
- Maintenance and bug fixes on some of our legacy codes. This includes refactoring.

Some of the tech stack I used:

- Flask and Nodejs (express) for backend
- Celery for batch jobs
- MySQL, BigQuery, Redis, MongoDB
- AWS
